        "# Project Walkthrough (Beginner)\n",
        "\n",
        "This project follows a structured machine learning workflow to predict credit risk. Here is a 10-step overview of the process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Environment Setup**: We load necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.\n",
        "2.  **Data Loading**: Historical loan data is imported from CSV files.\n",
        "3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We examine key variables like interest rates and debt-to-income ratios to understand their relationship with loan defaults.\n",
        "4.  **Feature Engineering**: New variables are created from existing ones to better capture borrower risk profiles (e.g., loan-to-income ratio).\n",
        "5.  **Data Splitting**: We split the data into training and validation sets to ensure we can test our models on unseen data.\n",
        "6.  **Preprocessing Pipeline**: A systematic process is established to handle missing values and convert categorical data into a format machines can understand.\n",
        "7.  **Model Training**: Multiple models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) are trained and tuned.\n",
        "8.  **Model Comparison**: We compare the performance of all models using standardized metrics like AUC and RMSE.\n",
        "9.  **Threshold Optimization**: We determine the best decision-making threshold to balance the cost of defaults against the benefit of approved loans.\n",
        "10. **Final Export**: All key results, models, and diagnostic charts are exported for reproducibility and reporting.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Glossary\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Target / Label**: The outcome we are trying to predict (in this case, whether a loan defaults).\n",
        "- **Feature**: An input variable used to make a prediction (e.g., borrower income, loan amount).\n",
        "- **Train / Val / Test**: Data splits used for building the model (Train), tuning it (Val), and final verification (Test).\n",
        "- **Pipeline**: A sequence of data processing steps and models chained together.\n",
        "- **One-Hot Encoding**: A method to convert categorical text data (like \"Home Ownership\") into numbers.\n",
        "- **Imputation**: The process of filling in missing data values with estimates (like the median).\n",
        "- **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**: A metric measuring how well the model distinguishes between \"default\" and \"non-default\" (higher is better).\n",
        "- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: A measure of the average difference between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes (lower is better).\n",
        "- **Threshold**: The \"cut-off\" probability used to decide if a loan should be approved or rejected.\n",
        "- **Confusion Matrix**: A table showing how many predictions were correct vs. incorrect for each class.\n",
        "- **Expected Value**: The average outcome of a decision when considering both the probability and the financial impact of different results.\n"

        "The chart above shows which variables the model relies on most to predict loan defaults. Here is a plain-English interpretation of the top features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Interest Rate (`int_rate`)**: Borrowers with higher interest rates are more likely to default. This is often because the lender already identified them as higher risk at the time of the loan application.\n",
        "2.  **Credit Grade (`grade_...`)**: Internal risk grades assigned by the lender are strong predictors. Lower grades (e.g., E, F, G) typically show a higher risk of default.\n",
        "3.  **Debt-to-Income Ratio (`dti` or `sqrt_dti`)**: Borrowers who spend a larger portion of their income on debt payments are more likely to struggle with new loan repayments.\n",
        "4.  **Revolving Utilization (`revol_util`)**: Using a high percentage of available credit card limits suggests a borrower may be overextended.\n",
        "5.  **Inquiries in Last 6 Months (`inq_last_6mths`)**: A high number of recent credit applications can be a sign of financial distress or an urgent need for cash.\n",
        "6.  **Annual Income (`annual_inc` or `log_annual_inc`)**: Higher income generally correlates with a lower risk of default, as borrowers have more cushion to handle unexpected expenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: These are *correlational* signals, not *causal*. For example, a high interest rate doesn't necessarily *cause* a default; rather, high-risk borrowers are both more likely to default and more likely to be charged higher rates.\n"

Under these assumptions, the optimal threshold is chosen to minimize expected loss (or maximize expected value). It is important to note that the resulting Expected Value (EV) may be negative if the baseline default rate is high or if the model’s discriminative power is limited. The sensitivity analysis (`threshold_sensitivity.csv`) further explores how the optimal threshold and corresponding EV shift under different cost-benefit calibrations, highlighting the dependence of the policy on these business assumptions.\n",
